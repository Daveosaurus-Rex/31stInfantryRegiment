<h3> If ... </h3>
	
<p style="text-align:justify;">
If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
   Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
   But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
   Or, being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
Or, being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
   And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;<br>
</p>
<p>
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
   If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
If you can meet with triumph and disaster<br>
   And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
   Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,<br>
   And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools;<br>
</p>
<p>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
   And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
   And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
   To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
   Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on”;<br>
</p>
<p>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
   Or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch;<br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>
   If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run—<br>
   Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!<br>
</p>
<p> 
Rudyard Kipling 1865 – 1936
