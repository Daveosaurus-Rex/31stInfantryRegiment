# 31stInfantryRegiment
This is a prototype website for the 31st Infantry Regiment Association

I am a novice website builder, so it is also a project for me to learn HTML and CSS
I expect the website to improve and look prettier as I gain more experinece

Ultimately I want to be able to communicate with the membership and world at large by:
Selling merchandise from our Quartermaster Store
Registister members for attendence at annual Reunions
Accept Donations
Sign up new members
Provide a place for members to comment to the membership at large, and
for individual members to connect with one another.
