					The 31st Infantry Regiment: A History of “America’s Foreign Legion” 
					in Peace and War (McFarland, 519 pp. $45, paper). 
					The three men were career soldiers who served in the 31st Infantry Regiment. 
					They know combat.<br><br>
					As the unit’s Regimental Historian for twenty years, Karl Lowe recorded 
					the 31st from its activation in the Philippines in 1916 through the 
					Vietnam War. In this book James Simms expands on the unit’s action 
					in Vietnam, and Grady Smith reports on activities in Iraq and 
					Afghanistan. An excellent selection of photographs from archives 
					and personal sources supplements their writing.

					In 1942, as Japanese forces advanced on Corregidor, soldiers from the US Army’s 
					31st Infantry Regiment burned the regimental battle standards and buried a silver bowl 
					and cups. The bowl was a prized Army heirloom known as the Shanghai Bowl, and the 
					soldiers didn’t want it to fall into enemy hands. When the war was over, a contingent, 
					including one who helped bury the bowl, returned to Corregidor to retrieve it. 
					It took two months of digging, but they eventually unearthed it.
