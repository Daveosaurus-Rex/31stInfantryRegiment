		<h2>About Your Website</h2>
<center>
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
	Greetings Polar Bears
    </p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
	This is your website, now under construction.
    </p> 	
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		The story is that we've had problems finding a Polar Bear or Friend of the Regiment who can maintain 
		a website and we don't have the resources to employ a commerical developer 
		to create and maintain a website.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		I looked into the use of website resource providers (e.g., Godaddy & Squarespace)
		and found that the tools and templates available were geared for "commerical" websites 
		where people were buying and selling, whether merchandise, services, or themselves. 
		I further discovered that beyond very basic website designs, the costs were also not
		neglible.
    </p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		My first encounter with programming was at age 18 as an entering freshman at university.
		Since then, off and on, I have written computer programs in Algol, Basic, Fortran, and to
		a lesser extent, C and Python, and some hardware-specific languages for controlling machines.
    </p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		So, I figured, maybe I should take a look at the difficulty of creating a website. 
		It just means learning (yet another) computer language. 
		Turns out, there is a range of difficulty, but the basics are easy and if you go
		to your local library and look in the children's section you can find "How To" books
		for 12 year olds on how to create a website. So, I basically started at the 12-year-old 
		level, and progressed using internet "how to" sources and videos to create the website
		that you are reading this meassage on.
    </p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		This note is to invite you to explore the "static" portion of this website. By "static" 
		I mean the only interaction that you can have with it is to click on "buttons".
    </p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		The more complicated part of website design and construction are the interactive
		services necessary to "sign up" as a website user, "logging in" once you have signed up,
		"Events" where you could register (and pay for) for the Reunion, "Quartermaster Store"
		where you could purchase merchandise, and "Sound Off" where you can share your
		observations, opinions, and personal news with your brothers-in-arms. 
    </p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		So, please, explore the website; click all the buttons and look at all the pages.
		Then give me your critiques and suggestions for improvements. You can email suggestions
		to me at david_kennedy@qed-petrophysics.com. 
    </p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		FUTURE DEVELOPMENT: As you read this, I am learning the skills necessary to complete
		the website by making the dynamic parts operational. You can well appreciate that the 
		dynamic funtions that take your personal information such as credit card numbers must
		be perfectly secure before we launch the "dynamic" website.
    </p> 
	<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		VOLUNTEER: If you have any programming skills and are interested in participating in the
		development and maintence of this website. I am 76 years old and sooner or later, probably sooner than
		later I'll need to be initiating a protege to take the reins.		
    </p> 
		<p style="text-align:justify;"> 
		At your service - Pro Patria <br>
		David Kennedy
